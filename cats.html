<h1>Here are my cats!</h1>

<h2>This is Solo.</h2>
<img src="images/Solo.jpg" alt="It's a cat">
<p> This is my cat, Han Solo. We call him Solo for short. He is seven years old.</p>
<p> His hobbies include sleeping. Watching Cat TV on Youtube and chasing ghosts</p>

<h2>This is Oreo,</h2>
<img src="images/Oreo.jpg" alt="It's another cat">
<p> Oreo is the newest addition to our family. He is almost a year old, so he's still a kitten</p>
<p> His hobbies include meowing for food, meowing for attention, and clawing at Solo.</p>

<h2> Why, cats?</h2>
<ul>
<li> They are soft and snuggly</li>
<li> They are affectionate but not needy</li>
<li> Easy to clean after</li>
</ul>
